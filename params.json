{"name":"d'Artagnan ","tagline":"Easy Hosting for Restaurant Owners","body":"### Welcome to d'Artagnan\r\n\r\nEvery restaurant webpage needs the same basic things. Directions to your locations so customers can find you. Menus so that they know what you serve and how much cash to have. A phone number to place an order or make a reservation. Your story so they know who you are and why they want your food. \r\n\r\nYou don't need a flash slideshow of people eating your food. You don't need music that plays automatically. You don't need an overcomplicated design that looks sleek but is hard to find. \r\n\r\nd'Artagnan gives you exactly what you need and nothing you don't. \r\n\r\n### Clean and Simple Design\r\nDesigned using Bootstrap, the same basic design components as Twitter, d'Artagnan looks good out of the box. You don't need a design degree or any complicated tools - simple changes to CSS brand it as your own in minutes without overcomplicating things.\r\n\r\n### Simple Administration\r\nPowered by Django, d'Artagnan has a built in easy to use admin interface. Just log in and quickly add new locations, change your story, update your menu and set up your sales. Have multiple employees that need to have access? It's easy to give them access to what they need and keep control of what they don't for yourself.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDesigned by @Feasoron\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nNeed the website customized more for your business?
